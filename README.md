built_redux is a state management library written in dart that enforces immutability.
built_redux is not only an implementation of [redux][redux_git], but also a framework for building middleware and reducers in a type safe manner.

Inspired by [redux][redux_git]

Built using [built_value][built_value_git]

## Using dart 2?
Check out the [dart 2 dev branch](https://github.com/davidmarne/built_redux/tree/dart-2-dev), which works with the latest versions of build, build_runner, and built_value.

## Framework bindings

[flutter]

## Examples

- [counter app](example/example.dart)
- flutter [todo_mvc], written by [Brian Egan]
- vanilla dart, angular, and wui_builder [todoMVCs]
- [retro] - firebase and angular

## Libraries

- [thunk][built_redux_thunk]
- [rx][built_redux_rx]
- [repatch][built_redux_repatch]
- [flutter_stream_redux](https://github.com/long1eu/flutter_stream_redux)
